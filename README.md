# Workshop-2

## Working on Workshop 2 - (20/1/25)
Okay so setInterval and setCounter are really cool ideas and I really love to see the possibilities of using such. I've been trying to utilise them in the way that Leo has done in the example, and I am trying to combine both however I keep running into issues. My idea was inspied by messing around with the squares that Leo had generated as an example and I had figured out how to round their corners so they looked like cirles, which in turn look like drops of blood. My idea was to make a background that looked like a pavement and the droplets to appear on it a lá someone bleeding on the sidewalk. Kind of grim but it was inspired by my own personal experiences of having severe bloody nose attack a year or so ago.
- This message keeps popping up when I'm trying to run my script on p5.js and I don't know what to do so I emailed Leo:

- Also it seems like VS Code is not showing me previews any more so I asked about that too:

- Waiting now to hear back from Leo
- Also I found this question by searching the error online and I was pleased to see that at least it wasn't just me having this issue:

- Okay I managed to get it working and I've successfully made my blood droplets, now I'm going to change the background to a tshirt (maybe bloody) and I may add a title screen so that it's like a story (like the screen saying wham and then showing the bloody shirt insinuating being hit in the nose)
