# Workshop-2

## Online Meet 2 (15/1/25)
Leo Demos Github, I’ve made an account but haven’t used it yet. Looking into 6 of 21 artists, one of which I will need to study and use as inspiration. Leo is talking about using Github but I don’t know how to use it. So far I have just put photos of my work on these slides so I will email him after this call on how to use Github and move my p5.js files onto it as well as make whatever is expected of us on there. It seems like Github will now be the major way of me taking notes which is making me very worried because I don’t really know what I’m doing. Forking to share files on Github.
- Organise all these notes in Github and make it into a README file because that is what I need to hand in
