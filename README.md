# Workshop-2

## Online Meet 2 (15/1/25)
Leo Demos Github, I’ve made an account but haven’t used it yet. Looking into 6 of 21 artists, one of which I will need to study and use as inspiration. Leo is talking about using Github but I don’t know how to use it. So far I have just put photos of my work on these slides so I will email him after this call on how to use Github and move my p5.js files onto it as well as make whatever is expected of us on there. It seems like Github will now be the major way of me taking notes which is making me very worried because I don’t really know what I’m doing. Forking to share files on Github.
- Organise all these notes in Github and make it into a README file because that is what I need to hand in

## Working on Workshop 2 - (20/1/25)
Okay so setInterval and setCounter are really cool ideas and I really love to see the possibilities of using such. I've been trying to utilise them in the way that Leo has done in the example, and I am trying to combine both however I keep running into issues. My idea was inspied by messing around with the squares that Leo had generated as an example and I had figured out how to round their corners so they looked like cirles, which in turn look like drops of blood. My idea was to make a background that looked like a pavement and the droplets to appear on it a lá someone bleeding on the sidewalk. Kind of grim but it was inspired by my own personal experiences of having severe bloody nose attack a year or so ago.
This message keeps popping up when I'm trying to run my script on p5.js and I don't know what to do so I emailed Leo:

Also it seems like VS Code is not showing me previews any more so I asked about that too:

Waiting now to hear back from Leo
